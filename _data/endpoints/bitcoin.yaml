      heading: Decentralization
      text: |
        Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning
        it is not controlled by any government
        or financial institution. This makes it
        resistant to censorship and manipulation.

      heading: Fast Transactions
      text: |
        Bitcoin transactions are processed
        quickly, and can be confirmed in minutes
        with low transaction fees. However, during
        times of high network congestion, fees can
        increase and transaction times can slow down.

      heading: Limited Supply
      text: |
        There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins
        in existence, making it a scarce asset that
        cannot be easily manipulated by inflation.
