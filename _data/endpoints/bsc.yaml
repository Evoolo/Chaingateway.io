  heading: What Is Binance Smart Chain
  text: Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a high-performance blockchain that runs in parallel with the Binance Chain. It is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and supports smart contract development. BSC uses Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism that combines Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Authority (PoA) to ensure high speed and low transaction fees.
