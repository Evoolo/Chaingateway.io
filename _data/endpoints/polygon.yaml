  heading: What Is Polygon
  text: Polygon (formerly known as Matic Network) is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to improve scalability and user experience for decentralized applications (DApps). Polygon provides faster and cheaper transactions on Ethereum using Plasma side chains and a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.

      heading: High Scalability
      text: |
        Polygon can process up to 65,000 transactions per second on a single side chain, and has the potential to scale even further with its proposed Polygon SDK.
