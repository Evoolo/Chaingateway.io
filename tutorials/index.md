Welcome to the tutorial section. Here we have prepared some code examples for you to help you get started with Chaingateway.io's API.

## Authentication
Every request needs an API key. You can easily create one in our web app.

This API key must then be included in every request in the 'Authorization' header.

{% highlight json %}
"Authorization": "apikey"
{% endhighlight %}

## More examples

If your programming language is not supported here, you can generate automatic examples in our API docs at docs.api.chaingateway.io by selecting your language in the header section.
