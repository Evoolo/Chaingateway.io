Welcome to the tutorial section. Here we have prepared some code examples for you to help you get started with our api. 

## Authentication
Every request needs an api key. You can easily create one in our web app. 
<p><img src="./auth.jpg"  width="100%"> </p>
This api key must then be included in every request in the 'Authorization' header. 

{% highlight json %}
"Authorization": "apikey"
{% endhighlight %}

## More examples

if your programming language is not supportet here, you can generate automatic examples in our api docs at ([docs.api.chaingateway.io](https://docs.api.chaingateway.io)) by selecting your language in the header section.
